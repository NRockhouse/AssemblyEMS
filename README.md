# AssemblyEMS
AssemblyEMS is a text user interface (TUI) event management system intended for school clubs and universities, written in Assembly (Turbo Assembly / TASM flavour) for DOS. This project is written and submitted as my Assembly module assignment, but references to my university has been removed in this uploaded version.

# Building
The built `MAIN.EXE` has already existed inside the repository if you wanted to try it out.

To build the program after modifying the source code, I've used an installation of DOSBox and TASM. For Windows users, a [DOSBox+TASM bundle by Techapple.net](https://techapple.net/2013/01/tasm-windows-7-windows-8-full-screen-64bit-version-single-installer/) is available for download on their site. It should theoretically work on a bare bones MS-DOS, but it is untested (I mean, how would I? I don't just have a random IBM potato sitting in my store room at my disposal).

Executing `RUN.BAT` would compile and run the program by executing TASM, TLINK, and lastly the program, in order.
